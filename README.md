# STCW River-crossing game

## Running the game

To run the game execute the Run batch file in the command line

## Objectives of the game

Cross the river from one side to the other.

## Rules

To cross the you would need to pick up planks. 
1. You may only pick up a plank by pressing the end of the plank that is closer to the player.
2. You may pick up only planks that are close to the stump that the person is standing.
3. You may pick up only one plank at a time.
4. You may only play plank next the stum that the player is on (click the water right next to the stump).
5. Having a plank picked up would result in placing it after it has been placed in the inventory.

## Issues
1. After winning the no message indicates to the player that the game has been won. The only thing that happens is that the timer stops
2. Planks can only be picked up by pressing on the end of the plank that is closer to the player's stump due to a very simplistic way of checking if its allowed to be picked up
